# Zoom Pro for Hack Club leaders

**HQ is buying a Zoom Pro account for every Hack Club this semester.**

_Note: We're only paying for Zoom Pro accounts through the end of this semester. We're developing `/z` and once it reaches the point where we're using it instead of our Zoom Pro accounts at HQ, we intend to switch all clubs to it._

_`/z` in beta is currently available to use by anyone - both leaders and members - but for now full Zoom Pro accounts still have more features._

This is only available to your club’s point of contact; the point of contact then can create meetings for the club. If you’re not sure if you’re the point of contact, running the command will let you know who that this. If the point of contact is the wrong leader, reach out to @matthew or @msw.

## How to redeem

1. Sign into the Hack Club Slack
2. Type `/get zoom pro`
3. Accept your email invite & sign up
4. Have fun!
