# Notion for Hack Clubbers

Notion is a popular tool for shared documents, databases, task lists, and more. If you’re running a Hack Club or organizing a hackathon, it’s fantastic for keeping track of everything with your team. We’re fans of Notion at Hack Club HQ, and Notion is giving every Hack Clubber their [Personal Pro plan free for students](http://www.notion.so/students), which includes unlimited storage, unlimited uploads, version history going back 30 days, and advanced permissions when you work with teammates!
