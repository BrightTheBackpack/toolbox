This is a system built on trust. Every shipment request is manually sent by someone at HQ, and every sticker shipment is personally prepared, packed, and mailed.

We are relying on you to be a responsible user of it. Stickers are funded by donations to Hack Club and are not cheap - every package costs real donor money.

It's OK to use this system for good faith, creative purposes. Meet someone cool and want to send them some Hack Club stickers? Great! That's awesome. Exactly what this is for.
